## Without Heading (Basic)

| Floating Alert |
| -------------- |
| **Important:** This is an example without a heading. The content will display normally without title formatting. |

Note: The alert will appear immediately when the page loads and can be dismissed by clicking the X button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the Escape key. Once dismissed, it won't appear again until localStorage is cleared.

**Heading Processing:** When you include a heading (h1-h6) in your content, it will automatically be extracted as the alert title and displayed prominently at the top, followed by a horizontal rule separator, then the remaining content below.
