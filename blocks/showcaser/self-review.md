# Showcaser Block Self-Review

## Improvements Made
1. Organized configuration variables into a SHOWCASER_CONFIG object for better maintainability.
2. Improved accessibility by adding ARIA attributes to key elements.
3. Added support for a compact variation of the Showcaser block.
4. Reorganized CSS variables for better clarity and grouping.

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Implement keyboard navigation for better accessibility.
2. Add more language-specific syntax highlighting options.
3. Consider adding a search functionality for large code showcases.
4. Implement lazy loading for long code snippets to improve performance.

## Performance Considerations
- The block uses lazy initialization, becoming fully visible only when loaded.
- Long code snippets are initially collapsed to improve page load times and readability.
- Syntax highlighting is performed client-side to reduce server load.

## Accessibility
- Added ARIA attributes to improve screen reader compatibility.
- Implemented proper focus management for interactive elements.
- Ensured color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards.

## Browser Compatibility
The Showcaser block has been tested and works well on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge). Some features may have limited functionality on older browsers, but core content display remains accessible.
