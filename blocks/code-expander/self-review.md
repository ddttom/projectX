- [x] No inline styles in JavaScript (all styling is in CSS)
- [x] Code is well-organized and follows a logical structure
- [x] Variable and function names are descriptive and follow consistent naming conventions

## Accessibility

- [x] All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [x] Focus states are clearly visible for all interactive elements
- [x] ARIA attributes are used where appropriate
- [x] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [x] Line numbers are non-selectable to improve user experience when copying code
- [x] Modal for filename input is keyboard navigable (Tab, Enter, Escape)

## Responsiveness

- [x] Block displays correctly on mobile devices
- [x] Button positioning is adjusted for smaller screens
- [x] Text remains readable on all screen sizes
- [x] Modal for filename input is responsive and usable on mobile devices
- [x] Touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile use

## Performance

- [x] DOM manipulation is minimized and efficient

- [x] CSS selectors are efficient
- [x] JavaScript functions avoid unnecessary calculations or operations

## Documentation

- [x] README.md provides clear usage instructions
- [x] EXAMPLE.md shows how to use the block in a Franklin document
- [x] demo.md showcases the block's functionality with various examples

- [ ] Implement a theme switcher for different syntax highlighting color schemes
- [ ] Add a search function within code blocks
- [ ] Add code folding for specific sections
- [ ] Add an option to remember the last used filename for downloads
- [ ] Implement syntax validation for specific languages
- [ ] Add an option to highlight specific lines of code

## Browser Compatibility

- [x] Works in Chrome
- [x] Works in Firefox
- [x] Works in Safari
- [x] Works in Edge

## Final Assessment

The Code Expander block successfully meets all core requirements and provides a robust, user-friendly experience for displaying and interacting with code snippets. The implementation follows best practices for Franklin block development, with a focus on accessibility, performance, and responsive design. The block is well-documented and includes examples for content authors.

The addition of global code block processing enhances the block's utility by allowing it to automatically find and process all code blocks on a page, making it much easier to enhance existing content without manual updates to each code snippet.

The non-destructive processing approach ensures that original code blocks remain intact on the page while still providing enhanced functionality. This prevents issues where code elements might disappear when using the code-expander block, improving reliability and user experience.

While there are opportunities for future enhancements, the current implementation provides significant value and improves the experience of working with code snippets in Franklin documents.
