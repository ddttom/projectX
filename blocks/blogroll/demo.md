## Compact Blogroll

Note: This compact blogroll will default to showing posts from the current page's folder path and page name (without any part number). The filtering is case-insensitive.

## Usage

The Blogroll block displays a list of blog posts grouped by series. You can filter the displayed posts by specifying paths in the rows below the block name.

The compact variation adds a floating icon (ðŸ“š) with the text "Blogroll" in the top-left corner of the viewport. Clicking on either the icon or the text opens a slide-out panel, providing a more space-efficient option for displaying the blogroll.

### Compact Variation Features:

- Floating icon (ðŸ“š) with "Blogroll" text in the top-left corner  
- Slide-out panel from the left side when clicked  
- Panel contains a sticky header with "Blogroll" title and close button (Ã—)  
- Close panel by clicking outside, pressing Escape, or clicking the close button  
- Compact format of blog posts within the panel  
- "Show All Posts" button at the bottom of the panel to toggle between all posts and the filtered view

## Accessibility

The compact variation supports keyboard navigation (Escape key to close the panel) and includes ARIA attributes for better screen reader compatibility.
