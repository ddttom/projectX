## Key Concepts

### From JSON to Full Applications

The journey through modern framework integrations with Edge Delivery Services starts with vanilla JavaScript, then progresses through Vue, React, Web Components, and Adobe Spectrum. This headless approach transforms how developers think about Edge Delivery Services.

### What You Can Build

- Product catalogues with advanced filtering  
- Interactive image galleries  
- Data visualizations and charts  
- Dashboard interfaces  
- All while maintaining Edge Delivery Services' core performance strengths

### Architecture Philosophy

Each framework adds organization while preserving the speed that makes Edge Delivery Services compelling. The goal is to go beyond static pages and create rich, interactive experiences through thoughtful architecture and modern JavaScript techniques.

## Optional

- [Portfolio Overview](https://allabout.network/): Main website showcasing various Edge Delivery Services projects and experiments.  
- [Technical Deep Dives](https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/): Additional technical articles exploring Edge Delivery Services capabilities.  
- [Performance Benchmarks](https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/performance/): Comparative analysis of different framework implementations.  
- [Best Practices Guide](https://allabout.network/blogs/ddt/best-practices/): Recommendations for optimal Edge Delivery Services development.

## Implementation Details

### Converting Vanilla JavaScript to Frameworks

The next evolution involves converting vanilla JavaScript implementations to structured frameworks. Each architecture adds organization patterns while maintaining performance:

- React: Component-based architecture with virtual DOM  
- Vue: Progressive framework with reactive data binding  
- Web Components: Native browser standards for encapsulation  
- Adobe Spectrum: Enterprise-ready design system components
