**Vision**: Become the leading privacy-first web framework for content-driven websites, enabling organizations to deliver exceptional user experiences without compromising user privacy or performance.

## Product Overview

### Core Value Proposition

ProjectX Framework addresses critical limitations in Adobe EDS by providing:

1. **Complete Privacy Protection**: Zero external data collection or tracking
2. **Exceptional Performance**: 80% bundle size reduction (54KB vs 270KB)
3. **Seamless Migration**: 100% EDS compatibility for effortless transition
4. **Enhanced Development Experience**: Local development server with zero dependencies
5. **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy-first design meets regulatory requirements

### Target Market

**Primary Audience**:
- Organizations using Adobe EDS seeking privacy compliance
- Companies requiring GDPR-compliant web solutions
- Development teams prioritizing performance optimization
- Businesses concerned about user data collection and tracking

**Secondary Audience**:
- Web agencies building privacy-focused solutions
- Educational institutions requiring privacy protection

## Product Architecture

### Primary-Clone Architecture

**Core Design Pattern**:
```
window.projectX (Primary) â†’ window.hlx (Clone Proxy)
```

**Implementation Benefits**:
- **Authoritative Source**: `window.projectX` contains all core functionality
- **EDS Compatibility**: `window.hlx` provides transparent proxy for existing code
- **Composition Pattern**: Delegation rather than duplication for maintainability
- **Migration Safety**: Existing EDS code works without modification

### Privacy-First Framework

**RUM Removal Implementation**:
```javascript
// Complete tracking elimination
const privacyConfig = {
  rum: { enabled: false, endpoint: null, sampling: 0 },
  analytics: { enabled: false, providers: [] },
  tracking: { pixels: false, cookies: false, fingerprinting: false }
};

// Deprecation warnings for legacy RUM calls
window.hlx.rum = new Proxy({}, {
  get(target, prop) {
    console.warn(`RUM method '${prop}' is deprecated in ProjectX for privacy protection`);
    return () => {}; // No-op function
  }
});
```

**Local-Only Monitoring**:
- Performance metrics stored in localStorage
- No external data transmission
- User interaction tracking (local only)
- Error logging without personal data
